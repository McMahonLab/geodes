#### Diel transcriptomics of freshwater lakes

GEODES stands for "Gene Expression in Oligotrophic, Dystrophic, and Eutrophic Systems."
In this experiment, we collected RNA from three lakes every 4 hours for 48 hours, with the goal of analyzing diel trends.
The aims of this project are:

- Identify interspecies(taxa) carbon compound exchanges, particularly between phototrophic and heterotrophic bacteria
- Identify carbon compounds used by the community that have no standing pool in the environment (cryptic compounds)
- Compare RNA to DNA to find out what proportion of the community is active, and what proportion of their genomes are active
- Generate new reference genomes for freshwater
- Identify new pathways and potential functions based on co-expression of genes
- Look at genes of interest from previous studies, such as actinorhodopsin

####Where do I get the data?

Are you in the McMahon Lab or one of our collaborators?

- Go to /lakes_data/Metatranscriptomes/ on our server, Zissou. Files are separated by lake from there.
- If you can't access Zissou, ask Alex for the GEODES hard drive

Not in the lab but curious about our data?

- Download our data from http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Diecycetabolisms/Diecycetabolisms.info.html . Most metatranscriptomes will become public on Aug 1, but some samples are earlier and others later.
- Shoot us an email! trina.mcmahon@wisc.edu or amlinz@wisc.edu

__BE WARNED__ We're not making this data available on Github because it would far exceed our space limit. The quality filtered, compressed metatranscriptome files total 153GB as of 2017-02-01, _and we don't even have all of the data yet._ Download at your own risk.
