Diel transcriptomics of freshwater lakes

GEODES stands for "Gene Expression in Oligotrophic, Dystrophic, and Eutrophic Systems."
In this experiment, we collected RNA from three lakes every 4 hours for 48 hours, with the goal of analyzing diel trends.
The aims of this project are:
* Identify interspecies(taxa) carbon compound exchanges, particularly between phototrophic and heterotrophic bacteria
* Identify carbon compounds used by the community that have no standing pool in the environment (cryptic compounds)
* Compare RNA to DNA to find out what proportion of the community is active, and what proportion of their genomes are active
* Generate new reference genomes for freshwater
* Identify new pathways and potential functions based on co-expression of genes
* Look at genes of interest from previous studies, such as actinorhodopsin
